# Socket Connection Fix - Authentication Timing Issue

## Problem Identified
The socket was trying to connect **before** the user logged in:
```
🔌 Socket connect() called
🔑 Token available: false
⏸️ Socket connection skipped: User not authenticated yet
```

After login, the token became available but the socket **never reconnected** because `useSocketConnection()` only ran once on app mount.

## Root Cause
The `useSocketConnection` hook had an empty dependency array `[]`, meaning it only ran once when the component mounted. When the user logged in and the auth state changed, the hook didn't re-run to establish the socket connection.

## Solution Applied

### `/src/hooks/useSocket.ts`
Made the socket connection **reactive to authentication state**:

```typescript
export const useSocketConnection = () => {
  const { isAuthenticated, accessToken } = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.auth);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Only connect if authenticated and has token
    if (isAuthenticated && accessToken) {
      console.log('✅ User authenticated, connecting socket...');
      socketManager.connect();
    } else {
      console.log('⏸️ User not authenticated, skipping socket connection');
      // Disconnect if user logs out
      if (!isAuthenticated) {
        socketManager.disconnect();
      }
    }
    
    // ... event listeners ...
    
  }, [isAuthenticated, accessToken]); // ← Re-run when auth state changes
}
```

## What Changed
1. **Added Redux selector** to watch `isAuthenticated` and `accessToken`
2. **Added dependencies** `[isAuthenticated, accessToken]` to useEffect
3. **Conditional connection** - only connects when user is authenticated
4. **Auto-disconnect** - disconnects when user logs out
5. **Enhanced logging** - shows auth state and connection attempts

## Expected Behavior Now

### On App Launch (Not Logged In)
```
🔄 useSocketConnection effect - isAuthenticated: false, hasToken: false
⏸️ User not authenticated, skipping socket connection
```

### After Login
```
🔄 useSocketConnection effect - isAuthenticated: true, hasToken: true
✅ User authenticated, connecting socket...
🔌 Socket connect() called
🔑 Token available: true
🔑 Token preview: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiI...
🔗 Connecting to: https://pulse-api-8yia.onrender.com
🔌 Socket connection initialized, waiting for connect event...
✅ Socket connected: [socket-id]
✅ Socket connected event received in hook
```

### On Logout
```
🔄 useSocketConnection effect - isAuthenticated: false, hasToken: false
⏸️ User not authenticated, skipping socket connection
🔌 Disconnecting socket...
✅ Socket disconnected
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Clear app data** (or uninstall/reinstall)
2. **Launch app** - should see "User not authenticated, skipping socket connection"
3. **Login** - should immediately see:
   - "User authenticated, connecting socket..."
   - "Socket connected: [id]"
4. **Open a chat** - should work normally
5. **Send message from another device** - should appear instantly
6. **Logout** - should see "Disconnecting socket..."

## Additional Fixes Still Needed

### Backend Deployment
The backend CORS fix still needs to be deployed to Render:
```bash
cd pulse-api
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Socket.IO CORS for production"
git push
```

This enables the production server to accept socket connections from mobile clients.

## Files Modified
- `/src/hooks/useSocket.ts` - Made socket connection reactive to auth state
- `/src/utils/socketManager.ts` - Enhanced logging (from previous fix)
- `/pulse-api/src/config/realtime.config.ts` - CORS fix (needs deployment)
- `/pulse-api/src/realtime/socket.server.ts` - Message enrichment (needs deployment)

## Next Steps
1. ✅ **Frontend fix applied** - Socket now connects after login
2. ⏳ **Deploy backend** - Push CORS fixes to Render
3. 🧪 **Test** - Login and verify socket connection in logs
4. 🎉 **Enjoy real-time messaging!**
