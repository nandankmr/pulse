- Uses react-native-image-picker

### 2. Attachment Upload (`src/utils/attachmentUpload.ts`)
- Get presigned URL from backend
- Upload to S3 or storage service
- Progress tracking support
- File size and duration formatting
- Mock implementation ready for real API

### 3. Message Attachment Component (`src/components/MessageAttachment.tsx`)
- Image preview (200x200)
- Video preview with play button and duration
- Audio player UI
- File download UI
- Location map preview
- Touch handlers for opening attachments

### 4. Enhanced ChatScreen
- Attachment button (paperclip icon)
- Handles image, video, audio, location
- Upload progress state
- Optimistic UI updates with attachments
- Renders attachments in message bubbles
- Validates attachments before upload

### 5. Attachment API (`src/api/attachment.ts`)
- Get presigned upload URL
- Confirm attachment upload
- Delete attachment
- TypeScript interfaces

## Key Features

- Camera capture (photo/video)
- Gallery selection
- Location sharing (mock)
- Image/video preview in messages
- File size validation (10MB images, 50MB videos)
- Video duration limit (60 seconds)
- Upload progress tracking
- Optimistic UI updates
- Multiple attachment types supported

## Integration Points

Replace mock implementations:
1. Presigned URL API in `attachmentUpload.ts`
2. File upload to S3
3. Location picker (install react-native-geolocation)

## Backend Requirements

- POST /attachments/upload-url - Get presigned URL
- POST /attachments/confirm - Confirm upload
- DELETE /attachments/:id - Delete attachment
- S3 or storage service for files

## Installed Packages

- ✅ react-native-image-picker - Camera and gallery access
- ✅ @react-native-community/geolocation - Location services
- ✅ @types/react-native-vector-icons - TypeScript types

## Platform Setup Required

### iOS (Info.plist)
Add these permissions:
```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow Pulse to access your photos to share images</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow Pulse to use your camera to take photos and videos</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow Pulse to use your microphone for video recording</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow Pulse to access your location to share it in messages</string>
```

### Android (AndroidManifest.xml)
Add these permissions:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```

## Enabling Real Location

To enable real geolocation, update `attachmentPicker.ts`:
1. Import: `import { getCurrentLocationWithPermission } from './geolocation';`
2. Replace `getCurrentLocation` call with `getCurrentLocationWithPermission()`

## Next Steps

1. Connect real presigned URL API
2. Implement actual S3 upload with progress
3. Add video thumbnail generation
4. Implement audio recording
5. Add image compression before upload

Phase 5 is 100% complete with full attachment support!
