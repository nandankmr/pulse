# Registration Navigation Fix

**Issue:** Navigation error when clicking "Create account" button  
**Error:** `The action 'NAVIGATE' with payload {'name':'EmailVerification',...} was not handled by any navigator.`  
**Date Fixed:** October 14, 2025

## 🐛 Problem

After clicking "Create account" on the registration screen, the app crashed with a navigation error. The `EmailVerification` route couldn't be found.

### Root Cause

The `useRegister` hook was setting the authentication state (`isAuthenticated: true`) immediately after registration. This caused the navigator to switch from the **unauthenticated stack** to the **authenticated stack**, where the `EmailVerification` route doesn't exist.

**Navigation Flow (Before Fix):**
```
1. User fills registration form
2. Clicks "Create account"
3. useRegister sets isAuthenticated = true ❌
4. Navigator switches to authenticated stack
5. RegisterScreen tries to navigate to EmailVerification
6. EmailVerification route not found in authenticated stack
7. CRASH ❌
```

---

## ✅ Solution

Modified `useRegister` hook to **NOT set authentication state** after registration. Users should only be authenticated **after email verification**, not after registration.

### Changes Made

**File:** `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
export const useRegister = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: (data: RegisterRequest) => registerAPI(data),
    onSuccess: async (response) => {
      const { user, tokens } = response;

      // ❌ This was setting auth state too early
      dispatch(setAuth({
        user,
        accessToken: tokens.accessToken,
        refreshToken: tokens.refreshToken,
        deviceId: tokens.deviceId,
      }));

      await saveAuthTokens(...);
      await saveUserData(user);
    },
  });
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
export const useRegister = () => {
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: (data: RegisterRequest) => registerAPI(data),
    onSuccess: async () => {
      // ✅ Don't authenticate yet - user must verify email first
      console.log('Registration successful, awaiting email verification');
    },
  });
};
```

## 🔄 Correct Flow (After Fix)

```
1. User fills registration form
2. Clicks "Create account"
3. useRegister completes (no auth state change) ✅
4. Navigator stays in unauthenticated stack ✅
5. RegisterScreen navigates to EmailVerification ✅
6. User enters OTP
7. useVerifyEmail sets isAuthenticated = true ✅
8. Navigator switches to authenticated stack ✅
9. User is logged in ✅
```

## 📋 Navigation Stack Structure

### Unauthenticated Stack
- Login
- Register
- **EmailVerification** ← Available here ✅
- ForgotPassword
- ResetPassword

### Authenticated Stack
- Main (Tabs)
- Chat
- CreateGroup
- GroupSettings
- EditGroup
- UserSearch
- ChangePassword

---

## 🎯 Authentication Flow

### Correct Order:
1. **Register** → User creates account (NOT authenticated)
2. **EmailVerification** → User verifies email (NOW authenticated)
3. **Main** → User can access app

### Why This Matters:
- Users shouldn't access the app without verifying email
- Email verification is a security requirement
- Backend might not return tokens until email is verified
- Keeps users in the correct navigation stack

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Registration Flow:
1. ✅ Open app → See Login screen
2. ✅ Tap "Sign Up" → See Register screen
3. ✅ Fill form and tap "Create account"
4. ✅ Should navigate to EmailVerification screen (no crash)
5. ✅ Enter OTP and verify
6. ✅ Should navigate to Main screen (authenticated)

### Test Navigation:
- ✅ EmailVerification accessible from Register
- ✅ Can't access Main without verification
- ✅ After verification, can access all authenticated screens

## 💡 Key Learnings

### Authentication State Management
- Only set `isAuthenticated: true` after **email verification**
- Registration alone doesn't mean authenticated
- Navigation stack depends on authentication state

### React Navigation
- Routes are scoped to their stack (auth vs authenticated)
- Can't navigate to routes in different stacks
- Stack switching happens when auth state changes

### User Flow
- Registration → Verification → Authentication
- Each step has a purpose
- Don't skip verification step

### Modified:
- `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Removed auth state setting from useRegister

### Unchanged (but relevant):
- `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` - Navigation structure
- `src/screens/RegisterScreen.tsx` - Navigation to EmailVerification
- `src/screens/EmailVerificationScreen.tsx` - Sets auth after verification

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Backend Expectations
Make sure your backend:
- Returns success response after registration (even without tokens)
- Sends OTP to user's email
- Returns tokens **after** email verification
- Validates email before allowing login

### Frontend Behavior
- User stays unauthenticated until email verified
- Can't access app features without verification
- Must complete verification to proceed

---

## 🎉 Result

Registration flow now works correctly:
- ✅ No navigation crashes
- ✅ Proper authentication flow
- ✅ Email verification enforced
- ✅ Secure user onboarding

---

**Issue Resolved!** Users can now register and verify their email successfully. 🚀
