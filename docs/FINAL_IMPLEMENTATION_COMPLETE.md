2. Selects "Edit Message"
3. Input field shows with current text
4. Blue banner shows "Editing message"
5. Send icon changes to checkmark
6. Close button to cancel
7. On save → Socket.IO emits edit event
8. Optimistic UI update

### Delete Flow
1. User long-presses message
2. Selects delete option

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Time limit checks
canEditMessage(message) // 15 minutes
canDeleteForEveryone(message) // 1 hour

// Socket.IO calls
editMessage({ messageId, content, conversationId })
deleteMessage({ messageId, conversationId, deleteForEveryone })

// Optimistic updates
setMessages(prev => prev.map(msg => 
  msg.id === messageId ? { ...msg, content, editedAt } : msg
))
```
